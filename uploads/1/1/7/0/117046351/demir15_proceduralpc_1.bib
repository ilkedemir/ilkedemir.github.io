abstract={Thanks to the recent advances in computational photography and
remote sensing, point clouds of buildings are becoming increasingly
available, yet their processing poses various challenges. In our work,
we tackle the problem of point cloud completion and editing and we
approach it via inverse procedural modeling. Contrary to the previous
work, our approach operates directly on the point cloud without an
intermediate triangulation. Our approach consists of 1) semi-automatic
segmentation of the input point cloud with segment comparison and
template matching to detect repeating structures, 2) a consensus-based
voting schema and a pattern extraction algorithm to discover completed
terminal geometry and their patterns of usage, all encoded into a
context-free grammar, and 3) an interactive editing tool where the user
can create new point clouds by using procedural copy and paste
operations, and smart resizing. We demonstrate our approach on editing
of building models with up to 1.8M points. In our implementation,
preprocessing takes up to several minutes and a single editing operation
needs from one second to one minute depending on the model size and the
operation type.},
