abstract={We present a framework for the conversion of existing 3D
unstructured urban models into a compact procedural representation that
enables model synthesis, querying, and simplification of large urban
areas. During the de-instancing phase, a dissimilarity-based clustering
is performed to obtain a set of building components and component types.
During the proceduralization phase, the components are arranged into a
context-free grammar, which can be directly edited or interactively
manipulated. We applied our approach to convert several large city
models, with up to 19,000 building components spanning over 180 km
squares, into procedural models of a few thousand terminals,
non-terminals, and 50-100 rules.},
