abstract={Inverse procedural modeling discovers a procedural
representation of an existing geometric model and the discovered
procedural model then supports synthesizing new similar models. We
introduce an automatic approach that generates a compact, efficient, and
re-usable procedural representation of a polygonal 3D architectural
model. This representation is then used for structure-aware editing and
synthesis of new geometric models that resemble the original. Our
framework captures the pattern hierarchy of the input model into a split
tree data representation. A context-free split grammar, supporting a
hierarchical nesting of procedural rules, is extracted from the tree,
which establishes the base of our interactive procedural editing engine.
We show the application of our approach to a variety of architectural
structures obtained by procedurally editing web-sourced models. The
grammar generation takes a few minutes even for the most complex input
and synthesis is fully interactive for buildings composed of up to 200k
polygons.},
