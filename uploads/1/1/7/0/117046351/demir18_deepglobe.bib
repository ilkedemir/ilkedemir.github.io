abstract={We present the DeepGlobe 2018 Satellite Image Understanding
Challenge, which includes three public competitions for segmentation,
detection, and classification tasks on satellite images (Figure 1).
Similar to other challenges in computer vision domain such as DAVIS[21]
and COCO[33], DeepGlobe proposes three datasets and corresponding
evaluation methodologies, coherently bundled in three competitions with
a dedicated workshop co-located with CVPR 2018. We observed that
satellite imagery is a rich and structured source of information, yet it
is less investigated than everyday images by computer vision
researchers. However, bridging modern computer vision with remote
sensing data analysis could have critical impact to the way we
understand our environment and lead to major breakthroughs in global
urban planning or climate change research. Keeping such bridging
objective in mind, DeepGlobe aims to bring together researchers from
different domains to raise awareness of remote sensing in the computer
vision community and vice-versa. We aim to improve and evaluate
state-of-the-art satellite image understanding approaches, which can
hopefully serve as reference benchmarks for future research in the same
topic. In this paper, we analyze characteristics of each dataset, define
the evaluation criteria of the competitions, and provide baselines for
each task.},
