If someone types in 'www.morgancc.edu', I want it to redirect to our mobile site located at 'www.morgancc.edu/m' However, I only need to redirect with this exact URL. I don't want it to redirect if you go to something like 'www.morgancc.edu/programs', which is what it is currently doing. Here is the code I have so far:

<script type="text/javascript">
if (window.location = "http://ilkedemir.github.io/") {
   window.location.href = 'http://ilkedemir.weebly.com'; 
}
</script>
